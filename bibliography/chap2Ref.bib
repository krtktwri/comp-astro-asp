	abstract = {The surfaces of neutron stars are sources of strongly polarized soft X rays due to the presence of strong magnetic fields. Radiative transfer mediated by electron scattering and free-free absorption is central to defining local surface anisotropy and polarization signatures. Scattering transport is strongly influenced by the complicated interplay between linear and circular polarizations. This complexity has been captured in a sophisticated magnetic Thomson scattering simulation we recently developed to model the outer layers of fully-ionized atmospheres in such compact objects, heretofore focusing on case studies of localized surface regions. Yet, the interpretation of observed intensity pulse profiles and their efficacy in constraining key neutron star geometry parameters is critically dependent upon adding up emission from extended surface regions. In this paper, intensity, anisotropy and polarization characteristics from such extended atmospheres, spanning considerable ranges of magnetic colatitudes, are determined using our transport simulation. These constitute a convolution of varied properties of Stokes parameter information at disparate surface locales with different magnetic field strengths and directions relative to the local zenith. Our analysis includes full general relativistic propagation of light from the surface to an observer at infinity. The array of pulse profiles for intensity and polarization presented highlights how powerful probes of stellar geometry are possible. Significant phase-resolved polarization degrees in the range of 10-60\% are realized when summing over a variety of surface field directions. These results provide an important background for observations to be acquired by {NASA}'s new {IXPE} X-ray polarimetry mission.},

The review discusses the Penrose process, the four laws of black hole mechanics, uniqueness of the solution, and the no-hair theorems. It also includes Kerr perturbation theory and its application to black hole stability and quasi-normal modes. The Kerr metric's importance in the astrophysics of quasars and accreting stellar-mass black hole systems is detailed. A theme of the review is the "miraculous" nature of the solution, both in describing in a simple analytic formula the most general rotating black hole, and in having unexpected mathematical properties that make many calculations tractable. Also included is a pedagogical derivation of the solution suitable for a first course in general relativity.},

We compute the atmospheric structure, emergent spectral fluxes and specific intensities for hydrogen, helium and iron atmospheres in a wide domain of effective temperatures and gravitational accelerations expected for neutron stars. The iron atmospheres are computed with the opacities and equations of state from the {OPAL} opacity library. We show that the model atmosphere spectra are substantially different from the blackbody spectra. For light element atmospheres, the flux is greater than the blackbody flux, and the spectrum is harder, at high photon energies, whereas at low energies the spectral flux follows the Rayleigh-Jeans law with a (surface) temperature lower than the effective temperature. The spectra of iron atmospheres display prominent spectral features in the soft X-ray range. The emergent specific intensity is anisotropic, with the anisotropy depending on energy. These properties of the atmospheric radiation should be taken into account for the proper interpretation of the thermal component of the neutron star radiation detectable at X-ray through {UV} energies. In particular, fitting of the thermal component with the blackbody model may result in substantially incorrect parameters of the radiating regions. We discuss an application of our atmosphere models to the nearby millisecond pulsar {PSR} J0437-4715.},

	abstract = {The contraction of a massive rotating plasma cloud with the magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of rotation and extending to infinity is considered. At some stage the contracting cloud reaches a state of dynamic quasi-stationary equilibrium. The change of the magnetic field in the cloud atmosphere before its arrival at the quasi-stationary state (stage I) and also in the process of quasi-equilibrium (stage {II}) are studied. At stage I an essential change of the external magnetic field geometry occurs, namely the formation of zero (neutral) lines and the transformation of the field into a quasi-radial one. Given certain conditions, the reconnection of the field lines in neutral X-type points may occur with the formation of closed loops. In this case the flux of field lines, which connect the contracting cloud with infinity, decreases asymptotically as (R/R i)2/3, {whereR}/R i is the ratio of the present radius to initial one. After the cloud arrives at the state of dynamic equilibrium (stage {II}) a considerable increasing of the magnetic field occurs due to twisting of the field lines by rotation. The field strength increases up to some threshold after which instability suddenly occurs. As a result of cumulation occurring in the zero-line direction, and the subsequent dynamic dissipation, the ejection of relativistic particles and plasma in both directions along the rotational axis takes place. The magnetic field restores itself rapidly due to the continual twisting and this leads to the appearance of repeated explosions. The tension of the magnetic field lines as well as plasma outflow carry away the angular momentum. Its diminution determines the rate of secular gravitational contraction. During the contraction the rotational energy increases, so that recurrent bursts, being of magneto-rotational nature are based, finally, on the gravitational energy reservoir. According to our calculations of the time-interval for repetition of explosions, the energy output and certain other parameters, we are able to explain repeated bursts in the nuclei of galaxies and quasars observed, in particular, in the appearance of radio-variability.},
