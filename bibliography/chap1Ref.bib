The computations for solving the coupled structure differential equations (both Newtonian and general relativistic) can be done using a symbolic computational package, such as Mathematica. In doing so, the student will develop computational skills and learn how to deal with dimensions. Along the way he or she will also have learned some of the physics of equations of state and of degenerate stars.},

	abstract = {We review the history of neutron star physics in the 1930s that is related to L. Landau. According to recollections of Rosenfeld (1974, Proc. 16th Solvay Conference on Physics, p. 174), Landau improvised the concept of neutron stars in a discussion with Bohr and Rosenfeld just after the news of the discovery of the neutron reached Copenhagen in February 1932. We present arguments that the discussion took place in March 1931, before the discovery of the neutron, and that they in fact discussed the paper written by Landau in Zurich in February 1931 but not published until February 1932 (Phys. Z. Sowjetunion, 1, 285). In his paper Landau mentioned the possible existence of dense stars which look like one giant nucleus; this can be regarded as an early theoretical prediction or anticipation of neutron stars, prior to the discovery of the neutron. The coincidence of the dates of the neutron's discovery and the paper's publication has led to an erroneous association of the paper with the discovery of the neutron. In passing, we outline the contribution of Landau to the theory of white dwarfs and to the hypothesis of stars with neutron cores.},

	abstract = {Pulsar Wind Nebulae ({PWNe}), structures powered by energetic pulsars, are known for their detection across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with diverse morphologies and spectral behaviour between these bands. The temporal evolution of the morphology and spectrum of a {PWN} depends strongly on the properties of the associated neutron star, the relativistic outflow powered by its rotational energy, and surrounding medium, and thereby can vary markedly between objects. Due the continuous, but decreasing, injection of electrons and positrons into the {PWN} by the pulsar, the brightness and spectral variation within and amongst their wind nebulae reflect the magnetic field structure and particle transport within the {PWN}. This can include complex motions such as reverse flows or turbulence due to shock interactions and disruption to the nebula. During the last stage of the {PWN}'s evolution, when the neutron star moves supersonically with respect to its environment, the escape of accelerated particles into the surrounding medium creates an extensive halo evident in very-high-energy gamma-rays. This chapter describes some of the identifying characteristics and key aspects of pulsar wind nebulae through their several evolutionary stages.},

Comparison with other measurements suggests that proper motion estimates derived from timing observations contain a source of error not accounted for in their quoted uncertainties. The information provided by the proper motion of the pulsars concerning the pulsar's origin, ages, magnetic field evolution, and kinetics of formation is discussed. The pulsars appear to have rms space velocities of about 210 km/sec in a non-Maxwellian distribution. They are moving away from the galactic plane, indicating an origin in low z-distance Population I progenitors. The data indicate that pulsars are born in supernova explosions of massive stars. The data rule out most of the suggested associations between pulsars and supernova remnants. The derived kinetic ages are generally less than the ages determined from the spin-down rate.},

	abstract = {With a selected sample of neutron star ({NS}) equation-of-states ({EOSs}) that are consistent with the current observations and have a range of maximum masses, we investigate the relations between {NS} gravitational mass \$M\_g\$ and baryonic mass \$M\_b\$, and the relations between the maximum {NS} mass supported through uniform rotation (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$) and that of nonrotating {NSs} (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {TOV}\}\$). We find that if one intends to apply an {EOS}-independent quadratic, universal transformation formula (\$M\_b=M\_g+A{\textbackslash}times M\_\{g\}{\textasciicircum}2\$) to all {EOSs}, the best fit \$A\$ value is 0.080 for non-rotating {NSs} only and 0.073 when different spin periods are considered. The residual error of the transformation is as large as \${\textbackslash}sim0.1M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. For different {EOSs}, we find that the parameter \$A\$ for non-rotating {NSs} is proportional to \$R\_\{1.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (where \$R\_\{1.4\}\$ is {NS} radius for 1.4\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ in unit of km). For a particular {EOS}, if one adopts the best-fit parameters for different spin periods, the residual error of the transformation is smaller, which is of the order of 0.01\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ for the quadratic form and less than 0.01\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ for the cubic form (\$M\_b=M\_g+A\_1{\textbackslash}times M\_\{g\}{\textasciicircum}2+A\_2{\textbackslash}times M\_\{g\}{\textasciicircum}3\$). We also find a very tight and general correlation between the normalized mass gain due to spin \${\textbackslash}Delta m{\textbackslash}equiv(M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {TOV}\})/M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {TOV}\}\$ and the spin period normalized to the Keplerian period \$\{{\textbackslash}cal P\}\$, i.e. \$\{{\textbackslash}rm log\_\{10\}\}{\textbackslash}Delta m = (-2.74{\textbackslash}pm0.05)\{{\textbackslash}rm log\_\{10\}\}\{{\textbackslash}cal P\}+\{{\textbackslash}rm log\_\{10\}\}(0.20{\textbackslash}pm 0.01)\$, which is independent of {EOS} models.

	abstract = {In a recent paper it is claimed that vacuum birefringence has been experimentally observed for the first time by measuring the degree of polarization of visible light from a Magnetar candidate, a neutron star with a magnetic field presumably as large as \$B{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\${\textasciitilde}G. The role of such a strong magnetic field is twofold. First, the surface of the star emits, at each point, polarized light with linear polarization correlated with the orientation of the magnetic field. Depending on the relative orientation of the magnetic axis of the star with the direction to the distant observer, a certain degree of polarization should be visible. Second, the strong magnetic field in the vacuum surrounding the star could enhance the effective degree of polarization observed: vacuum birefringence. We compare experimental data and theoretical expectations concluding that the conditions to support a claim of strong evidence of vacuum birefringence effects are not met.},

	abstract = {We review the current status and recent progress of microscopic many-body approaches and phenomenological models, which are employed to construct the equation of state of neutron stars. The equation of state is relevant for the description of their structure and dynamical properties, and it rules also the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We describe neutron star matter assuming that the main degrees of freedom are nucleons and hyperons, disregarding the appearance of quark matter. We compare the theoretical predictions of the different equation-of-state models with the currently available data coming from both terrestrial laboratory experiments and recent astrophysical observations. We also analyse the importance of the nuclear strong interaction and equation of state for the cooling properties of neutron stars. We discuss the main open challenges in the description of the equation of state, mainly focusing on the limits of the different many-body techniques, the so-called "hyperon puzzle," and the dependence of the direct {URCA} processes on the equation of state.},
