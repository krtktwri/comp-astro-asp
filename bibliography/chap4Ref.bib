	abstract = {In the last two decades, Bayesian inference has become commonplace in astronomy. At the same time, the choice of algorithms, terminology, notation, and interpretation of Bayesian inference varies from one sub-field of astronomy to the next, which can lead to confusion to both those learning and those familiar with Bayesian statistics. Moreover, the choice varies between the astronomy and statistics literature, too. In this paper, our goal is two-fold: (1) provide a reference that consolidates and clarifies terminology and notation across disciplines, and (2) outline practical guidance for Bayesian inference in astronomy. Highlighting both the astronomy and statistics literature, we cover topics such as notation, specification of the likelihood and prior distributions, inference using the posterior distribution, and posterior predictive checking. It is not our intention to introduce the entire field of Bayesian data analysis -- rather, we present a series of useful practices for astronomers who already have an understanding of the Bayesian "nuts and bolts" and wish to increase their expertise and extend their knowledge. Moreover, as the field of astrostatistics and astroinformatics continues to grow, we hope this paper will serve as both a helpful reference and as a jumping off point for deeper dives into the statistics and astrostatistics literature.},

	abstract = {The study of polarized radiation transfer in the highly-magnetized surface locales of neutron stars is of great interest to the understanding of accreting X-ray pulsars, rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars. This paper explores scattering transport in the classical magnetic Thomson domain that is of broad applicability to these neutron star classes. The development of a Monte Carlo simulation for the polarized radiative transfer is detailed: it employs an electric field vector formalism to enable a breadth of utility in relating linear, circular and elliptical polarizations. The simulation can be applied to any neutron star surface locale, and is adaptable to accretion column and magnetospheric problems. Validation of the code for both intensity and Stokes parameter determination is illustrated in a variety of ways. Representative results for emergent polarization signals from surface layers are presented for both polar and equatorial magnetic locales, exhibiting contrasting signatures between the two regions. There is also a strong dependence of these characteristics on the ratio of the frequency of a photon to the cyclotron frequency. Polarization signatures for high opacity domains are presented, highlighting compact analytic approximations for the Stokes parameters and anisotropy relative to the local field direction for an extended range of frequencies. These are very useful in defining injection conditions deep in the simulation slab geometries, expediting the generation of emission signals from highly opaque stellar atmospheres. The results are interpreted throughout using the polarization characteristics of the magnetic Thomson differential cross section.},

	abstract = {The detection of {GW}170817 and the accompanying electromagnetic counterpart, {AT}2017gfo, have provided an important set of observational constraints for theoretical models of neutron star mergers, nucleosynthesis, and radiative transfer for kilonovae. We apply the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code {ARTIS} to produce synthetic light curves of the dynamical ejecta from a neutron star merger, which has been modelled with 3D smooth-particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) and included neutrino interactions. Nucleosynthesis calculations provide the energy released from radioactive decays of r-process nuclei, and radiation transport is performed using grey opacities given as functions of the electron fraction. We present line-of-sight dependent bolometric light curves, and find the emission along polar lines of sight to be up to a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 brighter than along equatorial lines of sight. Instead of a distinct emission peak, our bolometric light curve exhibits a monotonic decline, characterised by a shoulder at the time when the bulk ejecta becomes optically thin. We show approximate band light curves based on radiation temperatures and compare these to the observations of {AT}2017gfo. We find that the rapidly declining temperatures lead to a blue to red colour evolution similar to that shown by {AT}2017gfo. We also investigate the impact of an additional, spherically symmetric secular ejecta component, and we find that the early light curve remains nearly unaffected, while after about 1 day the emission is strongly enhanced and dominated by the secular ejecta, leading to the shift of the shoulder from 1-2 to 6-10 days.},

We give, with the same accuracy, analytic formulae for circular geodesics in the Hartle-Thorne metrics. They describe angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, epicyclic frequencies, shear, vorticity and Fermi-Walker precession. These quantities are relevant to several astrophysical phenomena, in particular to the observed high frequency, kilohertz Quasi Periodic Oscillations ({kHz} {QPOs}) in the X-ray luminosity from black hole and neutron star sources. It is believed that {kHz} {QPO} data may be used to test the strong field regime of Einstein's general relativity, and the physics of super-dense matter of which neutron stars are made of.},

	abstract = {The problem of having an accurate description of the spacetime around neutron stars is of great astrophysical interest. For astrophysical applications, one needs to have a metric that captures all the properties of the spacetime around a neutron star. Furthermore, an accurate appropriately parameterised metric, i.e., a metric that is given in terms of parameters that are directly related to the physical structure of the neutron star, could be used to solve the inverse problem, which is to infer the properties of the structure of a neutron star from astrophysical observations. In this work we present such an approximate stationary and axisymmetric metric for the exterior of neutron stars, which is constructed using the Ernst formalism and is parameterised by the relativistic multipole moments of the central object. This metric is given in terms of an expansion on the Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates with the multipole moments as free parameters and is shown to be extremely accurate in capturing the physical properties of a neutron star spacetime as they are calculated numerically in general relativity. Because the metric is given in terms of an expansion, the expressions are much simpler and easier to implement, in contrast to previous approaches. For the parameterisation of the metric in general relativity, the recently discovered universal 3-hair relations are used to produce a 3-parameter metric. Finally, a straightforward extension of this metric is given for scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar field, which also admit a formulation in terms of an Ernst potential.},

	abstract = {Neutron stars in binary orbit emit gravitational waves and spiral slowly together. During this inspiral, they are expected to have very little vorticity. It is in fact a good approximation to treat the system as having zero vorticity, i.e., as irrotational. Because the orbital period is much shorter than the radiation reaction time scale, it is also an excellent approximation to treat the system as evolving through a sequence of equilibrium states, in each of which the gravitational radiation is neglected. In Newtonian gravity, one can simplify the hydrodynamic equations considerably for an equilibrium irrotational binary by introducing a velocity potential. The equations reduce to a Poisson-like equation for the potential, and a Bernoulli-type integral for the density. We show that a similar simplification can be carried out in general relativity. The resulting equations are much easier to solve than other formulations of the problem.},

	shorttitle = {The Magnificent Seven},
	abstract = {We model Galactic populations of accreting and cooling isolated neutron stars in the attempt to explore their link with a new class of dim soft X-ray sources revealed by {ROSAT}. For accretors we follow the magneto-rotational and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential and a realistic large scale distribution of the interstellar medium is used. Under standard assumptions old neutron stars enter the accretor stage only if their magnetic field exceeds \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ G. We predict about 1 source per square degree for fluxes \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-16\}\$ erg cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the energy range 0.5-2 {keV}. Cooling neutron stars are explored within a simpler model of local sources, including however interstellar absorption. They are found to be significantly less abundant at low fluxes, \${\textless}0.1\$ sources per square degree, but dominate over accretors at higher flux levels (\${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}\$ erg cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). We suggest that the faint sources observed by {ROSAT} may be young cooling neutron stars with typical age \${\textbackslash}la 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ yrs, if the total number of young neutron stars in the Solar proximity is \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ times higher than inferred from radiopulsars statistics.},

	abstract = {High-energy astrophysics is a relatively young scientific field, made possible by space-borne telescopes. During the half-century history of x-ray astronomy, the sensitivity of focusing x-ray telescopes-through finer angular resolution and increased effective area-has improved by a factor of a 100 million. This technological advance has enabled numerous exciting discoveries and increasingly detailed study of the high-energy universe-including accreting (stellar-mass and super-massive) black holes, accreting and isolated neutron stars, pulsar-wind nebulae, shocked plasma in supernova remnants, and hot thermal plasma in clusters of galaxies. As the largest structures in the universe, galaxy clusters constitute a unique laboratory for measuring the gravitational effects of dark matter and of dark energy. Here, we review the history of high-resolution x-ray telescopes and highlight some of the scientific results enabled by these telescopes. Next, we describe the planned next-generation x-ray-astronomy facility-the International X-ray Observatory ({IXO}). We conclude with an overview of a concept for the next next-generation facility-Generation X. The scientific objectives of such a mission will require very large areas (about 10000 m2) of highly-nested lightweight grazing-incidence mirrors with exceptional (about 0.1-arcsecond) angular resolution. Achieving this angular resolution with lightweight mirrors will likely require on-orbit adjustment of alignment and figure.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the polarization of X-rays in the \$2-8 {\textbackslash}thinspace {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{keV}\}\$ band from the nucleus of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A), using a 100ks observation from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer ({IXPE}). Nearly simultaneous observations of Cen A were also taken with the Swift, {NuSTAR}, and {INTEGRAL} observatories. No statistically significant degree of polarization is detected with {IXPE}. These observations have a minimum detectable polarization at \$99 {\textbackslash}\%\$ percent confidence ({MDP}\$\_\{99\}\$) of \$6.5 {\textbackslash}\%\$ using a weighted, spectral model-independent calculation in the \$2-8 {\textbackslash}thinspace {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{keV}\}\$ band. The polarization angle \${\textbackslash}psi\$ is consequently unconstrained. Spectral fitting across three orders of magnitude in X-ray energy (\$0.3-400 {\textbackslash}thinspace {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{keV}\}\$) demonstrates that the {SED} of Cen A is well described by a simple power law with moderate intrinsic absorption (\$N\_H {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{23\} {\textbackslash}thinspace {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) and a Fe K\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line, although a second unabsorbed power law is required to account for the observed spectrum at energies below \$2 {\textbackslash}thinspace {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{keV}\}\$. This spectrum suggests that the reprocessing material responsible for this emission line is optically thin and distant from the central black hole. Our upper limits on the X-ray polarization are consistent with the predictions of Compton scattering, although the specific seed photon population responsible for production of the X-rays cannot be identified. The low polarization degree, variability in the core emission, and the relative lack of variability in the Fe K\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line support a picture where electrons are accelerated in a region of highly disordered magnetic fields surrounding the innermost jet.},
