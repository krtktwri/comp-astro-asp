What is the question that we are trying to answer?
What would polarization data from Neutron stars look like. 

The puzzles that need to be solved can be broadly divided in two parts - 

1. Theoretical
    1.1 Territory of already known - 
        1.1.1 Introduction to Neutron stars
        1.1.2 Polarization production mechanisms 
        1.1.3 Sachs Formalism
        1.1.4 Gravtitational Correction to Polarization vector (in context of CMB)

    1.2 Territory of 'needs to be done' - 
        1.2.1 Gravitational correction to Polarization vector (in context of NS)
        1.2.2 Parallel transport of Sach's basis

    (Interlude - How to teach of any of this to a program)
2. Computational 

    - Already Done
    2.1 Photon trajectories and light bending
    2.2 Beloborodov Approximation
    2.3 Integrating over the surface (finding pulse profiles)

    - Needs to be Done
    2.4 Introduction of Magnetic Field
    2.4 Parallelizing using CUDA/HPC
    2.5 Computing parallel transport of basis vectors
