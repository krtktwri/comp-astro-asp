# Introduction  
This repository is for version controlling the code that I would be writing for my undergraduate thesis. 

# Physical system of interest 
The general problem that I am trying to understand along with my advisor (Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya) is to model what polarization data we should be expecting from the high-energy environments near astrophysical compact objects (primarily neutron stars). Due to the strong gravity regimes of such compact objects, light trajectories curve around the space near them. Effectively we expect contributions from the sides of the objects not directly facing the observer. Further, neutron stars have hotspots which have periodic visibility. Such effects (maybe more, maybe less) are to be incorporated in the code over the coming months.

# Progress Report

Sep 22 - Understanding how polarization undergoes parallel transport to be able to implement first and second order corrections for Schwarzschild geometries. <br>
Aug 22 - Finished the pulse profiles integration. Need to make it more adept to parallelization for running on Ashoka's HPC.
