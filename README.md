# Introduction  
This repository is for version controlling the code that I would be writing for my undergraduate thesis. 

# Physical system of interest 
The general problem that I am trying to understand along with my advisor (Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya) is to model what polarization data we should be expecting from the high-energy environments near astrophysical compact objects (primarily neutron stars). Due to the strong gravity regimes of such compact objects, light trajectories curve around the space near them. Effectively we expect contributions from the sides of the objects not directly facing the observer. Further, neutron stars have hotspots which have periodic visibility. Such effects (maybe more, maybe less) are to be incorporated in the code over the coming months.

# Progress Report
Dec 22 - Recreating polarization transport results from Hu et al (2022) currently. <br>
Nov 22 - Attempted analytic calculations using Sachs formalism and isentropic Schwarzschild coordinates to get the corrections. (Grad School application season = slow progress)  
Oct 22 - Gave a quarter-point update talk (chalkboard format) at Ashoka discussing elements from my thesis. Email for accessing lecture notes. <br>
Sep 22 - Understanding the theory behind how polarization undergoes parallel transport to be able to implement first and second order corrections for Schwarzschild geometries. <br>
Aug 22 - Finished the pulse profiles integration. Need to translate to the code to CUDA for GPU parallelization on university's HPC.
