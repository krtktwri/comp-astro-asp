# Introduction  
This repository is for version controlling the code that I would be writing for my undergraduate thesis. 

# Physical system of interest 
The general problem that I am trying to understand along with my advisor (Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya) is to model what polarization data we should be expecting from the high-energy environments near astrophysical compact objects (primarily neutron stars). Due to the strong gravity regimes of such compact objects, light trajectories curve around the space near them. Effectively we expect contributions from the sides of the objects not directly facing the observer. Further, neutron stars have hotspots which have periodic visibility. There is also varying doppler shift in the radiation coming from different locations. Such effects (maybe more, maybe less) are to be incorporated in the code over the coming months.
