# Introduction  
This repository is for version controlling the code that I would be writing for my undergraduate thesis. 

# Problem 
The broad problem that I am trying to solve along with my advisor (Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya) is to model what polarization data we should be expecting from the high-energy environments near astrophysical compact objects (primarily neutron stars). Due to the strong gravity regimes of these compact objects, light trajectories curve and effectively we expect contributions from the sides of the objects not directly facing us. Further, neutron stars have hotspots which pulsate. There is also varying doppler shift in the radiation coming from different locations. All these effects (and more) are to be implemented in the code over the coming months.

# Scripts

'exact.py' solves for photon trajectories 'exactly'. These exact trajectories are still approximations because we numerically solve the propagation equation. In the context of ray-tracing, where people try to find approximations which do not require solving differential equations, the solved DE is called 'exact'.
